Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
The inspiration I have chosen for my major assignment is the artistic approach of Picasso, particularly his ability to simplify complex subjects into abstract forms. I find this technique beneficial for my task, which involves gradually abstracting and simplifying Elaine de Kooning's "untitled bull" while retaining its essence. Picasso's technique allows me to reduce unnecessary details, highlighting key patterns and shapes while preserving the basic form of the artwork.
This is a Picasso artwork demonstrating how he simplifies complex subjects through the reduction of lines and shapes. I plan to employ a similar linear approach to transform "untitled bull" and emphasize its fundamental shapes and structures.

I plan to involve the Discrete Fourier Transform to approximate curves, which aligns seamlessly with the imaging technique inspired by Picasso's abstraction. By analyzing input data points, this method simplifies complex shapes, reminiscent of Picasso's abstraction of subjects into abstract forms. It achieves this by breaking down the shape into simpler geometric components. 
Key functions within the code play vital roles:
preload(): Loads input data from a CSV file.
initialValues(): Initializes crucial variables for Fourier series approximation.
parametricCurve(): Manages the curve's approximation using the Fourier series.
epicycles(): Visually represents the curve's decomposition into simpler components.
These functions enable the gradual abstraction of complex shapes while preserving their essence, retaining essential patterns and shapes.
